## Victor's Part

For now, I am responsible for the forms and user interaction on the client's side, that is any forms that clients fill and submit, and the way they interect with our website. I'll also be helping with the admin side of things, as that is the most complex part.

### To Work On (Client Side)

- Create and link javascript file ✅
- SignUp Form
  - Validate input ✅
  - Handle form submission ✅
  - Error handling ✅
- Sign In/Sign out forms
  - Validate input ⚠️
  - Handle form submission ✅
  - Error handling ✅
- Request Service functionality
  - Capture user requests for services
  - Store user requests temporarily.
- Customer Dashboard
  - Display past services
  - Display future services
  - Handle requests for cancelling services.


### To Work On (Admin Side)

- Handle customer requests
- Handle service completion

### NOTES
- Hardcode info: 
  - var isLoggedIn = true if form is handled.
  - Have 3 predefined emails and passwords as existing clients.
  - Create html for book-services (copy paste customer-dashboard and fix it up).

- Copy:
  - book service (if not signed in then redirect to sign up page). If service is booked then just output a confirmation and the bills.
